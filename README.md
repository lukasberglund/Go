# Go
Simple implementation of the ancient game of Go on a 9x9 board. The game has no end scoring right now so people have to do that themselves. In the future I want to add Player vs Bot in the future with AIs that I have built.

# Requirements
In order to run the game you need to have python3 and pygame installed. 

# Running the game
Use
```
python3 game.py
```
